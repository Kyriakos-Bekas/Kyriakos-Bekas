### Hi, I am Kyriakos

# I am a Front-end Developer (React)

## About Me

:mortar_board: I am currently studying **Computer Science** at the _Athens University of Economics and Business_ (Greece).

:art: I love creating web applications with seemless user experience, yet have clean structure and follow the universal web standards. I pay special attention to detail in every one of my projects and I always make them stand out.

:books: Some of the technologies that I am currently mastering and will soon be added to my stack are: **NextJS** and **Typescript**.

:fire: When I am not on my computer, I hang out with my friends, perform as a clarinetist in two bands and play D&D.
