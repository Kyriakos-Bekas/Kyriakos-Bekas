### Hi, I am Kyriakos

# I am a Front End Software Engineer (React)

## About Me

:mortar_board: I am currently studying **Computer Science** at the _Athens University of Economics and Business_ (Greece). I am also working at [Axiomatics](https://github.com/axiomatics) as a **Front End Software Engineer** since October 2022.

:art: I love creating web applications with seemless user experience, yet have clean structure and follow the universal web standards. I pay special attention to detail in everything I work on.

:books: Some of the technologies that I am currently mastering and will soon be added to my stack are: **NextJS** and **Jest**.

:fire: When I am not on my computer, I hang out with my friends, perform as a clarinetist in two bands and play D&D.
